    <h1>Hotel Bookings Exploratory Data Analysis</h1>

<h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>This project conducts an exploratory analysis of a hotel bookings dataset to uncover trends in hotel bookings and understand how different factors influence them.</p>

<h2>Dataset</h2>
    <p>The dataset comprises booking information for city and resort hotels, including features like booking cancellations, lead times, guest demographics, meal preferences, and more. Key statistics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Total rows:</strong> 119,390</li>
        <li><strong>Total columns:</strong> 32</li>
    </ul>

 <h2>Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Removed duplicate rows.</li>
        <li>Handled null values.</li>
        <li>Adjusted data types.</li>
        <li>Removed one outlier.</li>
        <li>Created new columns for better analysis.</li>
    </ul>

 <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>
    <p>Explored various questions, including popular agents, room types, meal preferences, booking sources, and more. Utilized visualization techniques like bar plots, histograms, and pie charts.</p>

 <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>1. City hotels are busier with slightly higher revenue.</p>
    <p>2. Guests prefer shorter stays, but resort hotels are favored for longer trips.</p>
    <p>3. Both hotels face high cancellation rates.</p>
    <p>4. Most guests originate from European countries.</p>
    <p>5. TA/TO is the preferred booking channel.</p>
    <p>6. GDS channels bring high ADR deals.</p>
    <p>7. July and August are the busiest and most profitable months.</p>
    <p>8. Couples are the most common guests.</p>
    <p>9. Longer stays may lead to better ADR deals.</p>

<h2>Challenges</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Dealing with duplicate data.</li>
        <li>Initial data type issues.</li>
        <li>Visualization technique selection.</li>
        <li>Handling null values.</li>
    </ul>
